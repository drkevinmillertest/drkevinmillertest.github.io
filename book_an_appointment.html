I have worked in a number of settings including hospitals, health centres, family centres and addiction centres. Having this diversity in my work experience gives me the ability to be flexible in my approach to clients and to understand needs from an individual and holistic perspective.

I use Mind-Body Attunement Therapy ® with clients. I also provide Certificate and Diploma level training in Mind-Body Attunement Therapy to other therapists. Mind-Body Attunement Therapy is a dynamic intervention which combines the traditional interpersonal therapies of pioneers such as Bowlby with current neurobiological approaches influenced by Schore and Levine.
            
        </p>
        <p>

Mind-Body Attunement Therapy ® helps establish emotional regulation which reduces suffering and enhance well-being by working directly with the physiological elements of relational trauma stored in the nervous system. Interventions access deeply held anger, sadness and fear and gently discharge the engergy by generating a sense of calm and paying attention to the sensory changes in the bodies.
